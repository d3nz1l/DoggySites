Email: @Model.EmailAddress
Phone: @Model.PhoneNumber
Experience: @Html.DisplayForEnum(m => m.Experience)
Address: @Model.Address

Their Dogs:
@foreach (var dog in Model.MembersDogs)
{
    var dogLine = string.Format(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture, "{0} - {1}({2}) - {3} - {4} - {5} {6}", dog.PetName, dog.KennelClubName, dog.KennelClubNumber, dog.Breed.ToDisplayString(), dog.DateOfBirth, dog.Gender, Environment.NewLine);
